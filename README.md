# Java project time management
 I am creating a scheduling app to help me organize my calendar. 
 
 First, the program will ask a few questions about the user's lifestyle so it can schedule activities like sleeping or eating into a convenient time frame. Then, the user will be asked to define their occupied time, such as working hours, school lessons, or any other commitments they need to organize around. Using the received data, the algorithm will set up a schedule for them and potentially propose a few minor changes, such as adjusting the sleeping schedule. The user will be able to decide whether or not they want to accept these proposals.

 Roadmap:
    Classes with userdata
    Algorithm
    Saving user data with schedule
    UI
    Google Integration
